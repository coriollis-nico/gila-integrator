Friedmann equation implementation and RK4 integration for GILA (exponential) and GR in Fortran 2008.

## How to use

### Requirements

- Fortran 2008 compiler (e.g. `gfortran`)
- `python` (for plotting - version shouldn't be too important)
    - `matplotlib`
    - `numpy`
- The [Fortran Package Manager ('fpm')](https://fpm.fortran-lang.org/) for compiling
(tested on v0.10.1, so usage is likely to change with further releases)
- [`ford`](https://github.com/Fortran-FOSS-Programmers/ford) (optional - doc creation)

### Compilation & execution

#### Fortran source

To compile using `gcc`,

    fpm run gr_integration --flag -std=f2008 --profile release
    fpm run curve_sandwich --flag -std=f2008 --profile release

For other compatible compilers, replace `-std=f2008` witht the apropiate flag for 2008 standard
compliance.

#### Scripts

Expect to be executed from project root directory

- `python scripts/curve_sandwich_plots.py` verifies the slope of the derivatives are
never positive & plots GR & GILA data generated by `gr_integration` and `curve_sandwich`
