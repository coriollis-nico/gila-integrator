# GILA Integrator

Friedmann equation implementation and RK4 integration for GILA (exponential) and GR in Fortran 2008.

## How to use

### Requirements

- Fortran 2008 compiler (e.g. `gfortran`)
- `python` (for plotting - version shouldn't be too important)
    - `matplotlib`
    - `numpy`
    - [`ford`](https://github.com/Fortran-FOSS-Programmers/ford)
    (optional - doc creation)
- `meson` for compiling

### Compilation

    meson setup build
    meson compile -C build

### Running

#### Binaries

Binaries expect to be run from project root directory

- `./build/gr_integration` generates GR data
- `./build/curve_sandwich`generates `early` GILA data (solutions & slow-roll parameters) for 3 m-p combinations & 3 energy scales

#### Scripts

Also expects to be executed from project root directory

- `python src/scripts/curve_sandwich_plots.py` verifies the slope of the derivatives are never positive & plots GR & GILA data generated by `gr_integration` and `curve_sandwich`
